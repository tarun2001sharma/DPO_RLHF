Now, I'm not usually one for bananas, but I keeping hearing they are much more flavorful here, so I decided I'd give it a go and bought a small bunch from the local market. Yesterday morning, I decided I'd have one for breakfast along with my usual corn flakes. After I wash it down with coffee, I immediately start feeling like crap, but one of my roommates had a stomach bug over the weekend, so I just automatically assume that I must have contracted said bug and rush off to my four hour class. Four hours of hell, that is. As soon as I sit down, my nose becomes a waterfall with off and on sneezing fits. Next, cue the most god awful indigestion and acid reflux I have ever experienced. I keep telling myself that I only have to make it to 1 o' clock, then I can just go to bed. Easier said than done, but I finally get home and find little success in napping. Once I get up, I discover that I have a nice little rash starting in each armpit, which I chalk up to having switched deodorants just that morning. Finish off a bottle of Maalox with some advil and commenced sleep attempt number two. I wake up a little more clear headed this time and begin to assess my situation. The rash is now worse and I start wondering, what if the deodorant didn't cause the rash? Is there a single thing that could possibly explain all of my symptoms? I started to ask myself out loud, \"Did I eat anything today that I don't usually..... oh, shit.\" In an instant my fingers were flying on Google to search \"banana allergy\" only to find a multitude of symptom lists that pretty much specifically described my day of hell. By this time, my face had even started to swell a bit, but now knowing what I  was up against, I bought some benedryl, had a couple of beers and went back to sleep. Woke up this morning feeling much better, and unlike Pam Poovey, I will not continue to stuff my face with foods I know I am allergic to. No more bananas. Ever.\n",
